# Jobs Project using Vite, JSON Server
This project uses React that is using Vite, along with JSON Server to mock a back end. 
Goal is to refresh on any updated changes to React and to prepare for React 19. 
React 19 will be removing `useContext`,  `useMemo`, and `useCallback` none of which we use in this project.
